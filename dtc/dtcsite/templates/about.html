	<h2> About Me</h2>
	<p class="lead"> My name is Anya Owsenek, and I was a student at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. 
My senior research lab is the Microelectronics Lab under director David Bell. 
I have taken an assortment of electronics and programming classes, and run the main TJ Electronics page(tjelectronics.tk), as well as my own webpage, aowsenek.tk, where you can read more about me and this project. 
My Digital Time Capsule was initially an idea I thought of when pondering all the funny, interesting, 
cool stories people have from their time at TJ, and I wanted a way to preserve that and pass it down to a later generation of students to reflect upon. 
I hope you find this site well, and have no issued uploading or downloading to it. 
For security reasons, only the TJ Sysadmins know where this capsule is. 
If there is any issues uploading or downloading with this project, contact one of them and email me at anya.owsenek@gmail.com. 
Please note that not all of the Rounds will be filled at every startup, and since I'm a lazy coder I hardcoded the names of the zip files to download. 
But if you cannot at least download Round 1, or if the year is after 2026 and you cannot download Round 2, do contact me. 
I also ask that you please refrain from submitting inappropritate materials, as there is no one regulating this project, 
and if there are complaints will be forced to get the sysadmins to manually filter content, and that defeats the purpose of this project. </br>
Thank you, and Long Live TJHSST!</br>
