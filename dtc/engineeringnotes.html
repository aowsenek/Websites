<h2> Engineering Notes</h2>

<hr>
<ol ><li><p>Raspberry PI A+. I have chosen the raspberry pi (RPI) A+ for its computational function, low price, and lower current requirement (as compared to the RPI B). While it does require a stabler environment (constant, regulated 5v power) than an Arduino Uno, the advantages of running a minicomputer instead of a basic project board far outweigh the requirements.</p>

</li>
<li><p>Real Time Clock (PCF85263A): I found it difficult to decide between the PCF85263A and another, more comprehensively functional RTC IC, by digikey. However, I decided that my low-power requirement for the RTC is more important than extremely accurate time correction, especially seeing as the WAITS capsule does not require a super-accurate form of timekeeping, though it could greatly benefit from it. It runs on 900mA</p>

</li>
<li><p>32 GB microSD cards: After careful research I have settled on two microSD cards that will be compatible with the A+. I would like to eventually order a microSD of greater capacity than 32GB, just to experiment to see if it is compatible with the A+, which I think is likely. However, the internet does not have any information on A+ compatibility with large SD cards (64-128GB). </p>

</li>
<li><p>Wifi Dongle: Because I have settled on the RPI A+, I have decided to use a wifi dongle instead of a chip extension, as it is easier to use and configure than the chip extension (which would be required to use with the Arduino)</p>

</li>
<li><p>Power: Remains a difficult issue. I have gone back and forth on several different types of power storage and generation. While a hydrogen fuel cell appears to be the best for long-term storage/ retaining potency, it is expensive and therefore not ideal. it also would only run for roughly two weeks before needing a replacement Hydrogen tank. I have contemplated various forms of alternative generation, such as solar, wind, and thermal. However, they do not generate nearly enough power to satisfy my requirements. I have not yet deemed any power sources that I have come across ideal. This power source will only supply power to the RPI.</p>

</li>
<li><p>This is a separate battery, a CMOS battery for the RTC to keep running while the RPI is dormant, However, since a button battery or regular alkaline battery would not provide enough power for long enough, this absolutely must be some form of power generation, such as a thermocouple or photodiode.</p>

</li>
<li><p>This is the “trigger” or the circuitry that will detect what time it is appropriate to connect the power source to the RPI and boot.</p>
