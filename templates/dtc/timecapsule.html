<p> As you can see in the table, the Raspberry Pi is far superior to the Arduno Uno. My project requires what is essentially a miniature computer. The Arduino, a device I had initially intended to use, when compared to the Raspberry Pi, came up short in almost every category except price and durability.</p>
<hr>
<h3> Storage</h3>
<p> Because the Raspberry Pi is a fully functional computer, it saves me the burden of having to write brand new code. Instead I have to modify existing frameworks and learn them, no simple task. This makes storing files and creating a user interface for the project easy, as all I need to do is launch an adhoc webserver with get and proc to upload and download files. A bash script to .zip the files together is a relatively simple task. However, due to signal degredation of a digital storage device such as a USB or SD card, the RPI must start up every four years and refresh the voltages.</p>
<h3> Webserver </h3>
<p>The WIFI adhoc network, DNS redirect, webserver, and website for the RTC all work, save for the permissions of the CSS files on the site. I have decided to temporarily put this on a backburner in order to work on the clock. For the adHoc network, I used Hostapd, for the DNS redirect, I used DNSmasq, the webserver was jointly run with NGINX and FLASK, and of course all the html and JS and CSS for the website are all their own. The upload/download works, however I still haev yet to write the shutdown shell script to.zip everything uploaded into a certain named file. I do, however, have a working startup script.</p>
</div>
<h1>Clock</h1><a id="clock"></a>
<p>The clock, the device that will count down the years and wait for the day to turn on the RPI, is an integrated chip called an RTC, or Real-Time Clock. These hyper-accurate chips smaller than your pencil eraser can utilize a backup power source, sound an alarm, account for leap years, and use miniscule amounts of power. The clocks in desktop computers can run off of button batteries for a decade. However, a challenge I have encountered with this device is the issue of power- if it is running constantly for five decades, what kind of power source can it use?</p>
<p>I have encountered issues with making the RPI compatible with the RTC, a OM13510 chip. There are about 20 different drivers for RTCs, and nowhere in the OM13510 documentation did it specify a particular driver, so finding the correct one fell to guess-check-reboot. Eventually I discovered that the necessary drievr is the rtc-ds1307 kernel driver for pidora. Despite this module being compatible, it still has issues: /dev/rtc-0 will not communicate with the RTC but passing -D (using /dev) does work. For some reason the RPI also views everything as outside of acceptable time range, and refuses to set. </p>
<h1>Power</h1><a id="power"></a>
<p>"Maintence free," the motto of my Digital Time Capsule, presents a difficult conundrum when confronted with the issue of power. There are no power sources, such as batteries, that can last for a decade and a half. Trickle charging is a moot point because batteries degrade over time, even when not in use, and after roughly 7 years cannot hold a charge. Renewable methods, such as solar panels or turbines place location constraints and power generation difficulties. But I have seen the light! The only clean-energy, nondegradable power source is a 5 Watt hydrogen fuel cell. However, as this device is expensive, proprietary, and limited in the power it can store, I have opted to put this issue on a backburner and if needed, use an outlet (thus breaking the "self-contained" goal) for the project. I will need a voltage regulator, but compared to the other options I could be fighting with right now, I'm not terribly concerned. An outlet also solves the problem of a seperate backup power source for the clock.</p>
